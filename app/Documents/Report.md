# [Team Name] Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* *Try to summarise and list the `bullet points` of your project as much as possible rather than give long, tedious paragraphs that mix up everything together.*

* *Try to create `diagrams` instead of text descriptions, which are more straightforward and explanatory.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report.*

*Please remove the instructions or examples in `italic` in your final report.*

## Team Members and Roles

| UID | Name | Role |
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| [uid] | [name] | [role] |
| [uid] | [name] | [role] |
| [uid] | [name] | [role] |
| [uid] | [name] | [role] |

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

*[Write a well defined protocol your team can use to handle conflicts. That is, if your group has problems, what is the procedure for reaching consensus or solving a problem? (If you choose to make this an external document, link to it here)]*

## Application Description

*[What is your application, what does it do? Include photos or diagrams if necessary]*

*Here is a pet specific social media application example*

*PetBook is a social media application specifically targetting pet owners... it provides... certified practitioners, such as veterians are indicated by a label next to their profile...*

**Application Use Cases and or Examples**

*[Provide use cases and examples of people using your application. Who are the target users of your application? How do the users use your application?]*

*Here is a pet training application example*

*Molly wants to inquiry about her cat, McPurr's recent troublesome behaviour*
1. *Molly notices that McPurr has been hostile since...*
2. *She makes a post about... with the tag...*
3. *Lachlan, a vet, writes a reply to Molly's post...*
4. ...
5. *Molly gives Lachlan's reply a 'tick' response*

*Here is a map navigation application example*

*Targets Users: Drivers*

* *Users can use it to navigate in order to reach the destinations.*
* *Users can learn the traffic conditions*
* ...

*Target Users: Those who want to find some good restaurants*

* *Users can find nearby restaurants and the application can give recommendations*
* ...

*List all the use cases in text descriptions or create use case diagrams. Please refer to https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-use-case-diagram/ for use case diagram.*

## Application UML

![ClassDiagramExample](./images/ClassDiagramExample.png)
*[Replace the above with a class diagram. You can look at how we have linked an image here as an example of how you can do it too.]*

## Application Design and Decisions

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design. Here is an example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*

    * *Objective: It is used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*

    * *Locations: line xxx in XXX.java, ..., etc.*

    * *Reasons:*

        * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*

        * *We don't need to access the item by index for this feature*

2. ...

3. ...

**Data Structures**

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

**Design Patterns**

*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

**Grammars**

*Search Engine*
<br> *Production Rules* <br>
\<Non-Terminal> ::= \<some output>
<br>
\<Non-Terminal> ::= \<some output>

*[How do you design the grammar? What are the advantages of your designs?]*

*If there are several grammars, list them all under this section and what they relate to.*

**Tokenizer and Parsers**

*[Where do you use tokenisers and parsers? How are they built? What are the advantages of the designs?]*

**Surpise Item**

*[If you implement the surprise item, explain how your solution addresses the surprise task. What decisions do your team make in addressing the problem?]*

**Other**

*[What other design decisions have you made which you feel are relevant? Feel free to separate these into their own subheadings.]*

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

*[Where are the known errors and bugs? What consequences might they lead to?]*

*Here is an example:*

1. *Bug 1:*

- *A space bar (' ') in the sign in email will crash the application.*
- ...

2. *Bug 2:*
3. ...

*List all the known errors and bugs here. If we find bugs/errors that your team do not know of, it shows that your testing is not through.*

## Testing Summary

*[What features have you tested? What is your testing coverage?]*

*Here is an example:*

*Number of test cases: ...*

*Code coverage: ...*

*Types of tests created: ...*

*Please provide some screenshots of your testing summary, showing the achieved testing coverage. Feel free to provide further details on your tests.*

## Implemented Features

*[What features have you implemented?]*
*Firebase Integration*
1. *Use Firebase to implement user Authentication/Authorisation. (easy)*
2. *Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app (this item replace the requirement to retrieve data from a local file) (medium)*
...
..
   
   *Here is an example:*
   
   *User Privacy*
   1. *Friendship. Users may send friend requests which are then accepted or denied. (easy)*
   2. *Privacy I: A user must approve a friend's request based on privacy settings. (easy)*
   3. *Privacy II: A user can only see a profile that is Public (consider that there are at least two types of profiles: public and private). (easy)*
   4. *Privacy III: A user can only follow someone who shares at least one mutual friend based on privacy settings. (Medium)*
   *Type 2*
      ...
   
## Team Meetings

- *[Team Meeting 1](./MeetingTemplate.md)*      // TODO - find Kev's 
- *[Team Meeting 2](./Meeting2_Minutes.md)*
- *TODO*

*Either write your meeting minutes here or link to documents that contain them. 
There must be at least 3 team meetings.*
