** To-Do List **
Pls Add item/make updates here 
Add your Name to the item - so that we won't crash (and also remove/update status if needed)

*** URGENT ***
* 1. MEDIUM FEATURE (or Hard/Very Hard also ok) *                       @[  ]

* 2. UI and workflow for everything works *
    - ** Local Data structure: change everything into using RBTree ! **

* 3. Search bar's linkage with Tokenizer, Parser (to workable)


*** Bugs ***

* new functions
    - Like: didn't change count (only once)
    - delete: didnt change user
    - both: >> implement the RBTree
    - firebase llike & post                         @Cathy (pushed, not yet test)


* Minor items that affect many different places 
    - ProfileActivity: REMOVE "proPicUrl", replace into e.g. Location (*cuz not enough time implement profile picture), and change User class


*** Minor but can be tedious ***

* 4. Revise UI (minor revisions) * (write down which part/parts/all that you are changing)
    - AppActivity: design it so that things could be placed into fragments?
    - logIn > main screen, with Create Account button, remove forgetPassword activity & layout
    - can finetune Current Post a bit
    
* 5. Checkings
    - Check UI input's validation & warning messages, and bugs
    - layouts (different emulator sizes): e.g. currentpost out of boundary Pixel API 30  
   
    

** Not Urgent and Optional **
* 1000 data instances > from real data source
* Screen 'tag' input after User Input, before Storing
