**URGENT + Fundamental**

* MEDIUM FEATURE (or Hard/Very Hard also ok) *                                @[  ]

* Bugs / incompleted new functions
    - currentPost: scroll up/down also get in Current Post 
    - Like: didn't change  count change at view (only +once but implemented multiple times)
    - delete UI: (1) didnt leave @Current Post, can press again and "Post deleted" (2) press "last" at android 
    - both: >> implement the RBTree
    - search > tok par > show result

* UI and workflow for everything works *
    - ** Local Data structure: change everything into using RBTree ! **


**Minor &  2nd Urgent**

* now also need data instances for delete & like......

* Revise UI (minor revisions) * (write down which part/parts/all that you are changing)
    - ProfileActivity: REMOVE "proPicUrl", replace into e.g. Location (*cuz not enough time implement profile picture), and change User class
    - AppActivity: design it so that things could be placed into fragments?
    - logIn > main screen, with Create Account button, remove forgetPassword activity & layout
    - Current Post: size out of bound, and layout can finetune  a bit
    - timeline: (long postId)     
    
* Checkings
    - Check UI input's validation & warning messages, and bugs
    - layouts (different emulator sizes): e.g. currentpost out of boundary Pixel API 30  
   
    

** Not Urgent and Optional **

* 1000 data instances > from real data source
* Screen 'tag' input after User Input, before Storing 
* firebase load @Cathy
